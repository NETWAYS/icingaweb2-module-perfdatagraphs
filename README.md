The data is fetched by a "backend module", at least one backend module also need to be enabled:

* [Graphite Backend](https://github.com/NETWAYS/icingaweb2-module-perfdatagraphs-graphite/)
* [Influxdb v1 Backend](https://github.com/NETWAYS/icingaweb2-module-perfdatagraphs-influxdbv1)
* [Influxdb v2 Backend](https://github.com/NETWAYS/icingaweb2-module-perfdatagraphs-influxdbv2)

This module aims to be a "batteries included" and opinionated solution.
Configuration options are limited by design.

## Features

* Interactive graphs for Host and Service performance data
  * Mouse click and select a region to zoom in
  * Click on a time range or double click to zoom out
* Graphs are adjustable via Icinga 2 custom variables
* Interchangeable performance data backends
  * Fetched data is cached to improve speed and reduce load on the backend

## Installation Requirements

* PHP version ≥ 8.0
* IcingaDB or IDO Database

## Documentation

Documentation for this module is available at [doc](doc/).

# Known Issues

### Inconsistent collapsible behavior during autorefresh

When there are mulitple graphs on the page
the autorefresh can sometimes cause inconsistent collapsible behavior.

# Road to Version 1.0.0

What our current idea for a version 1.0.0 of this module is:

* It should work with every Icinga performance data writer with minimal configuration by the user
* It should be a robust solution for all check plugins
* It should integrate seamlessly in the Icinga Web UI, without degrading performance
  (e.g. when a plugin lots of data)
* It should provide enough options for customization for most use cases
